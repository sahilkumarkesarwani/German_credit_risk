# German Credit Risk Modeling

A machine learning project to predict credit risk (good/bad) for bank loan applicants using the German Credit Dataset. Built as a portfolio project targeting roles in **Model Risk Management**, **Enterprise Risk Analytics**, and **Model Validation**.

---

## Problem Statement

Banks need to assess whether a loan applicant is likely to default. This is a binary classification problem:

- **0 → Good** — applicant is likely to repay
- **1 → Bad** — applicant is likely to default

Recall on the "bad" class is prioritized over accuracy — missing a defaulter costs far more than a false alarm.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [German Credit Data — Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/german-credit)
- **Size:** 1000 rows, 10 features
- **Class distribution:** 700 good, 300 bad (imbalanced)

| Feature          | Type        | Description                           |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Age              | Numeric     | Applicant age                         |
| Sex              | Categorical | male / female                         |
| Job              | Numeric     | Job skill level (0–3)                 |
| Housing          | Categorical | own / free / rent                     |
| Saving accounts  | Categorical | little / moderate / quite rich / rich |
| Checking account | Categorical | little / moderate / rich              |
| Credit amount    | Numeric     | Loan amount in DM                     |
| Duration         | Numeric     | Loan duration in months               |
| Purpose          | Categorical | car / furniture / radio/TV / etc.     |

## Project Pipeline

```
Raw Data
   ↓
Null Imputation (mode for categorical)
   ↓
Train-Test Split (80/20, stratified)
   ↓
Encoding (LabelEncoder for Sex, OneHotEncoder for categorical cols)
   ↓
SMOTE (on train set only — no leakage)
   ↓
Model Training (5 models)
   ↓
Evaluation (F1, Recall, AUC, Confusion Matrix)
   ↓
Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)
   ↓
Final Model: AdaBoost
```

> Note: XGBoost was also trained and evaluated separately (outside the main 5-model comparison above). AdaBoost was selected as the final model based on the Results below.

## Key Design Decisions

**Why SMOTE after train-test split?** Applying SMOTE before splitting would allow synthetic samples to leak into the test set, inflating evaluation metrics. SMOTE is applied only on training data to preserve the integrity of the test set — a critical requirement in model validation.

**Why Recall over Accuracy?** A model with 70% accuracy that never predicts "bad" is useless in credit risk. Recall on the bad class measures how many actual defaulters the model catches — the metric that matters to a bank.

**Why `predict_proba` for AUC?** AUC must be computed using predicted probabilities, not binary class labels. Using `predict` instead of `predict_proba` gives a misleading AUC score.

## Results

| Model               | Accuracy | F1        | Recall (bad) | AUC       |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.575    | 0.422     | 0.517        | 0.569     |
| KNN                  | 0.660    | 0.209     | 0.150        | 0.543     |
| Decision Tree        | 0.625    | 0.370     | 0.367        | 0.587     |
| Random Forest        | 0.585    | 0.394     | 0.450        | 0.596     |
| **AdaBoost**          | 0.565    | **0.453** | **0.600**    | **0.593** |

**Winner: AdaBoost** — highest recall (0.60), meaning it correctly identifies 60% of actual defaulters.

> KNN had the highest accuracy (0.66) but the worst recall (0.15) — a classic example of why accuracy is a misleading metric on imbalanced datasets.

## Limitations & Next Steps

Current results (AUC ≈ 0.59–0.60, recall ≈ 0.60 on the best model) are modest in absolute terms. In a real model-validation context, this would not clear a production bar. Key limitations:

- **Small dataset (1,000 rows)** limits how much signal any model can extract, especially after an 80/20 split leaves only ~800 training rows.
- **Shallow feature set** — no derived features (e.g. credit-amount-to-duration ratio, age-bucketed risk tiers), which likely caps model performance regardless of algorithm choice.
- **Limited hyperparameter search space** — GridSearchCV was run on a narrow grid; a wider search or Bayesian optimization (Optuna) may close some of the gap.

**Next steps:**
- Engineer interaction features (e.g. `credit_amount / duration`, `age` bucketed into risk tiers)
- Try CatBoost / LightGBM, which often handle mixed categorical data better out of the box
- Use stratified k-fold CV instead of a single train/test split, given the small sample size
- Calibrate probabilities (Platt scaling / isotonic regression) before setting a decision threshold
- Add SHAP values for model interpretability — critical for real credit-risk model validation
